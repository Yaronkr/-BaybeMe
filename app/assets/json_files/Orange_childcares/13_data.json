She didnt like fruits before but since we put her in there, she likes to eat fruits. She likes to eat food that she didnt like before and wants to try to eat before saying no. The other educators also amazing. People at orange said this is the best early learning centre in Orange. Before this centre, I put my daughter in 2 other centres,and this one is the best. Thank you.",
