Our child was supported in adapting and feeling confident and secure following our arrival to Australia, while the staff listened to our needs during that transitional time. Our child enjoys all the real animal experiences, celebrating multicultural holidays and learning through play. Our child has made strong bonds with the staff and children, enjoys an equal amount of physical and intellectual activity, is confident and happy. We will miss Alpha when our little one goes to school next year; it has been lovely to have that sense of community and warmth but also the confidence that our child is fully prepared for primary school. We would definitely recommend Alpha to anyone.","time":1524777549},{"author_name":"Lisa Eskander","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108578872303185538023/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AATXAJx1CkkCUSOEtywoessLo9uOzmWy2VbqWM5h7Mj-=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"3 years ago","text":"We couldn’t be happier.
