The educators are all wonderful and our toddler adores them. There is something special about Sentia… it’s always super clean and tidy, light and vibrant and has a very welcoming feel. It’s a small centre where all the educators and staff know all of the children and their parents and a special effort is clearly taken to make every family feel important and known. The centre is also managed incredibly well, with the director and assistant directors doing an exceptional job to make Sentia such a wonderful place. They are extremely warm and friendly and very involved with the children. They’re responsive, helpful and go that extra mile. The centre has very good quality toys and undertakes valuable educational and fun activities with the children (even the babies). Sentia values multiculturalism and celebrates a variety of international festivals/days of worship as well as Aboriginal education and recognition etc. which we really value. I am always recommending Sentia to new parents as we are so happy that we were fortunate enough to have found it. It’s truly a pleasure to leave our daughter there given how much she loves it and how well she’s looked after. I couldn’t recommend it highly enough!","time":1648178973},{"author_name":"Dania istwani","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113482257726617682757/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjgB6zuTj9iXAe4R5t8H9PshkZFGzYSGs8Zy4MI=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 months ago","text":"Leaving your child for the first time is one of the most difficult things you have to do, and yet Sentia made it easier for our family.\n\nMy daughter (2yo) has been there for over a month now, and everything went smoothly. They offered us two orientation sessions, where me and my daughter attended together so she can trust her new environment.\n\nThe educators are so kind, caring and professionals. They brief me everyday with what my baby did and what were the highlights of her day, so me and her get to discuss them later at home! This really build more trust and confidence, and I personally really care about these factors.\n\nAlso they offer the children good and variable meals.\nI would really recommend this centre to anyone whose looking for one in Melbourne CBD!","time":1647398645},{"author_name":"Ankita Vishal Tauro","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103303063976786329537/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AATXAJxk-v8LE_nfl6A1HA17LoPUes6o0X9y08lpSY6D=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"The best child care in the area.
