Firstly, the staff. Some seemed very agressive which made me feel unsafe to leave my child in their care. Also, dont seem very nurturing.\nSecondly, thery did not give me any centre information to leave with unless I enrolled my child there. Apparently it's policy.\nThank goodness for the tour, i wouldn't recommend leaving your child in their care.","time":1528067929}],"url":"https://maps.google.com/?cid=8284553835679362186","website":"http://ifp.mychild.gov.au/ChildCareService/Provider.aspx/4988/Joybelle-Child-Care-Centre"},"status":"OK"}
