The Centre Manager Belinda is always approachable and easily contactable, and is an absolute asset to the team, as well as many of the educators and assistants.

I remember walking in the very first time and was greeted by pleasant & knowledgeable staff I knew this was the right choice for our child. My little Hannah has been part of the babies group since two months ago and the educators have been nothing short of amazing, the respect, warmth, love & care,  shown at every drop off and pick up reassures me that our child is in the best care. I honestly can't fault Milestones Early Learning, the staff, communication & weekly menu's are fabulous. The play spaces have plenty of natural elements to explore, activities and regular updates through Storypark make for a hassle-free experience.",
