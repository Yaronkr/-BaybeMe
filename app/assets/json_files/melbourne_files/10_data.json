Our children have gone there for over 3 years and the experience has been great.\n\nThe educators are fantastic, are very welcoming to the children and work hard to keep the children active and stimulated. Food is very good (I never heard my children complain about it) and the centre is very well run overall. The daily dairy is a great tool to learn what the little ones have been up to and also encourages communication with the educators. Communication with management is also excellent.","time":1635383700},{"author_name":"Caroline Coletto","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108931804405083645898/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AATXAJyRreCjJoFqLzFmpgTzoMIlGJNap-KKK2EtD0M=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"9 months ago","text":"Great childcare with friendly, caring staff, small classes and modern facilities.\nWe started in nursery this year and it’s been such an easy transition with the help of OAC staff.

He eats and sleeps really well there so they must know the best methods and no tears at drop off!
