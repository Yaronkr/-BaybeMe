Lemon Tree has been an invaluable part of our lives for over 2 years. The  careers are beautiful, nurturing, positive role models who have genuine meaningful connections with all the children.  The centre is organised, clean and safe. The chef is a magician when it comes to nutritional fancy meals for kids. At first I worried there wasn’t enough grass & dirt, but quickly realised the stuff that mattered was the culture created by the centre staff, kids and their families, not grass! Plus there is dirt, plants, sand, water play and all kinds of activities. Our child would regularly come home in a second pair of clothes after joyfully playing in all manner of messy tactile world things!!   The staff and kids love being there, our child loved the place like family. They really cared about our child’s happiness and development. Sadly we recently moved from Melbourne but we will forever love the wonderful Lemon Tree community. There’s no other like it.","time":1626085473},{"author_name":"Rodolphe Ratheau","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100464517020055545737/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AATXAJxTCEvgn_AShfBXsh5QfaItS_xFX7m0OYfFixxD=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"Great center that makes my boys really happy.
