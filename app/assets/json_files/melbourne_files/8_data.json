We recently moved away from Richmond (to regional Vic, too far to continue attending) and leaving Petite was an incredibly sad part of the move. All the staff we encountered were so lovely and we never had a doubt our daughter was in good hands. She developed wonderful bonds with her regular carers and we cant speak highly enough of the 'Baby Boulevard' staff, especially Cece - words cant describe how incredible she is. From day one our daughter was comfortable at the centre, and even on her temperamental days, the staff knew exactly what to do to distract her, settle her and without fail we'd have a happy girl coming home at the end of the day. The Baby Boulevard room has a separate dark sleeping room which really helps the babies settle and enable them to sleep longer. The toys and play equipment were regularly rotated and changed to keep the kids interested and to provide new development and learning opportunities. There was also always tons of outside play which we really appreciated. When our daughter was ready to move to the older room they obviously did it in a really positive, supportive way as she had no trouble going into her new class when she fully transferred.\nMost of this happened throughout the Covid lockdowns and the staff were always very responsive and communicative, and dealt with a really difficult situation in a really positive way.\nWe highly recommend Petite Richmond to anyone looking for a supportive, caring and encouraging day care environment.","time":1617705126}],"url":"https://maps.google.com/?cid=7835042964636516476","website":"http://petitjourney.com.au/church-street"},"status":"OK"}
