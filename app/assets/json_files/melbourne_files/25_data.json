It has been like a second home to them. We've just moved out of the area and sadly we've had to move the kids to new daycare centers and I am grieving! The kids have received such wonderful, nurturing care during their time at Apple Blossoms. The program for the kinder kids are varied, thoughtful and exciting with a real focus on letting the kids develop their imagination and skills through play. The outdoor area is large and full of activities and trees. The nursery is a warm, calm space for babies to develop and my little one has loved her time there. The Centre provides excellent, regular updates though Storypark and I know a lot of effort goes into preparing the updates. The educators - Laura, Nick, Kirsty, Natsumi, Jasmine, Vanitha, Erin, Carrie, Isyanee - are all wonderful and they all helped both of our babies grow and flourish. Tina, the director, is professional, warm, loving and has instilled her very high standards throughout the Centre. I don't have a bad word to say about Apple Blossoms - and any negative reviews on Google would have been well before Tina's time and the arrival of the current staff, so you can disregard them. As soon as we are back in the area we will be straight back to Apple Blossoms.","time":1634598641},{"author_name":"Rebecca","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113614787965674943954/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GitEz-g-bWIs6TZGlm2oxVETUeSH3kd18kqWTSP=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"9 months ago","text":"My son is so happy at Apple Blossoms in South Melbourne, it's a smaller centre which makes it feel like visiting family.
