The educators are amazing, super friendly and warm. They genuinely bond with the kids. My 20 month old son and my 4 year old both attend brighton Street daycare and I couldn't be happier for them. None of them are reluctant to go. In previous centres, we hadn't reached their rooms that they sometimes started to cry. My 4 year old wants to go the day he isn't there, which is a good sign is having fun and is being taken care of very well.\nThe Director (new as of May), Fanny Phillips, is super professional and extremely responsive and she will really take your feedback into account. And, bonus for us, she is French, my kids are half French.\n.","time":1625805751},{"author_name":"David Argyle","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106779986545230622952/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gg-X0Y29pk4cq5Ddy4a4BolT_GL4KXmxHUNfHUQIg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"Our little girl loves it here!
