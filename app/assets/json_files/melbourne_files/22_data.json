They feel safe, looked after, they are learning new things and skills every day and always with a smile on their face. One of my children learned how read and write in their kindy program and the other one (currently in kindy) is almost there. It is a very safe environment for the kids to express themselves in any way, the staff is amazing, great management, always willing to listen and help whenever they can.
